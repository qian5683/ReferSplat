## Abstract
We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting
Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task that focuses
on segmenting target objects in a 3D Gaussian
scene based on natural language descriptions.
This task requires the model to identify newly
described objects that may be occluded or not
directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, **RefLERF**. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal
understanding and spatial relationship modeling
are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these
challenges, we propose **ReferSplat**, a framework
that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with
natural language expressions in a spatially aware
paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS
task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Code, trained models, and the dataset will
be publicly released.
